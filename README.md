# Rustoku: A Sudoku Engine
A high-performance Sudoku engine and solver written in Rust.

---
# Current Features:
- **SudokuBoard**: A robust, type-safe 9x9 board data structure.
- **validate_move**: Comprehensive logic to enforce Sudoku rules.
- **Safe Accessors**: Idiomatic `get` and `set` methods for reading and writing cell values.
- **Formatted Display**: A clean, human-readable function for printing the board.

# Planned Features: 
- **Logical Solver:** Implement a module to solve puzzles using logical deduction, resorting only to brute force if other approaches fail.
- **Puzzle Generator:** Create a module to generate new puzzles with varying difficulty levels.
- **Game Module:** Build a command-line interface for users to play Sudoku.
- **Error Handling:** Refine error messages with descriptive strings.
- **Testing:** Add a comprehensive test suite.
